# UnoJoyShifter
G27 Shifter USB using Uno R3 

Mod to use a Arduino Uno R3 to host a controller for the g27 Shifter. The pinout config is shown in the attached diagram. You will also need to add the UnoJoy library modified to accomodate the button count to compile and write it to the UNO board.

In addition to this you would need:

Arduino Uno R3
a small breadboard to place it on if you don't want to solder the cables onto the board directly
a small enclosure to host the converter in (recommended)
a DB9 Male Connector and a 9 cable line ribbon cable(only 8 lines are used though) . which you can purchase at electronics stores or you can harvest it from an old external serial port( I had one lying around)
